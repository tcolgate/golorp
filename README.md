# Nothing much here

This is an attempt implement a prolog in Go. Because
I like prolog, and I like Go and learning is fun.

If you want something that actually (probably) works,
please see https://github.com/mndrix/golog

So far I have a lexer that seems to approximate SWI, and
should be Unicode friendly.
